# Two_Electron_Phonon_Relaxation
Based off work by: NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 4:2069 | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms3069

Using same parameters in the above paper, I reproduced the 2 electron phonon-induced relaxation plot (Fig 3-b, not including inset plots). Using Two_Electron_Phonon_Relaxation.cpp, I produced the data in the relaxation.txt file and plotted that with the Mathematica file 2_electron_relaxation.nb
