# Two_Electron_Phonon_Relaxation
Based off work by PHYSICAL REVIEW B 90, 235315 (2013) DOI: 10.1038/ncomms3069

Using same parameters in the above paper, I reproduced the 2 electron phonon-induced relaxation plot (Fig 3-b, not including inset plots). Using Two_Electron_Phonon_Relaxation.cpp, I produced the data in the relaxation.txt file and plotted that with the Mathematica file 2_electron_relaxation.nb
